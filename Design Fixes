Design Fixes


1. In Mass.java - at the bottom of the class, there are four helper functions that come from the Vector class (angleBetween, angleBetween, distanceBetween, 
distanceBetween) that should be removed. We should figure out how to just use the implementation from the Vector class. 

2. If you look at the three forces: Gravity, Viscosity, CenterOfMass - Gravity is the only one that is implemented in Model.java. The other two have instance 
variables in the Mass.java class - myCenterOfMass, myViscosity. We probably want to follow the Gravity model and have Viscosity and CenterOfMass somewhere
in the model file. 

3. Duvall mentioned that there is no purpose in creating a class where all you do is have get/set methods. That, unfortunately is all Viscosity, CenterOfMass, 
and Gravity are... We need to think how we're going to handle that? Maybe add more logic into those classes? Right now, the only value I'm getting from having 
them be different classes is in my Factory.java file, when I call the add() method, because it is an overloaded method, it knows which type of force it is 
based on it's class type. (... don't know if that made sense)
