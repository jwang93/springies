Specs: 

Allow users to interact with the simulation while it is animating.

Multiple assemblies
By pressing 'n', allow users to load a new assembly into the simulation. It should be possible to animate multiple assemblies during the same simulation.
By pressing 'c', allow users to clear all loaded assemblies.

Mouse dragging
By clicking and dragging the mouse, allow users to interact with an assembly. When clicked, the nearest mass (in any assembly) should be selected and a 
spring created between that mass and the current mouse position. The rest length of the spring should be determined automatically so that the user can 
pull the assembly by moving the mouse away from it or push it by moving towards it. This spring should be removed when the mouse is released so the user 
can click again to interact with another assembly.

Toggle forces
By pressing 'g', 'v', 'm', allow users to toggle (turn on if it is off and off if it is on) the application of gravity, viscosity, and center of mass 
forces, respectively.
By pressing '1', '2', '3', '4', allow users to toggle (turn on if it is off and off if it is on) the application of the appropriate wall repulsion forces.
If a forces' values were not given in an environment data file, use a default value.

Change size of walled area
By pressing up arrow or down arrow, allow user to increase or decrease the size of the walled area in which the assemblies animate by 10 pixels on each 
side. This separates the area's size from that of the Canvas. It is okay to make the size larger than the Canvas's size, that just means an assembly 
(i.e., a pendulum) would not bounce off the sides of the window.



Notes:
	Definitely need to implement MouseListener and KeyListener 
	In Game, Duvall implemented getLastKeyPressed() and getLastMouseLocation() from Canvas.java 
	All of this is also taken care of for us in springies/Canvas.java 

Here are the available functions: 
    
    /**
     * Returns last key pressed by the user or -1 if nothing is pressed.
     */
    public int getLastKeyPressed () {
        return myLastKeyPressed;
    }

    /**
     * Returns all keys currently pressed by the user.
     */
    public Collection<Integer> getKeysPressed () {
        return Collections.unmodifiableSet(myKeys);
    }

    /**
     * Returns last position of the mouse in the canvas.
     */
    public Point getLastMousePosition () {
        return myLastMousePosition;
    }
    
They are handled by a setInputListeners() class. 


Design Notes:

Check starting forces:
	idea is to set each boolean (gravity, viscosity, centerOfMass, wallRepulsion) to T/F depending on whether it exists
