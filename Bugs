Bugs List:

1. When a fixed mass is in play, the gravity behaves correctly. When fixed mass is gone, the gravity goes
in the opposite direction. 

2. Problem w/ Center of Mass implementation? 
	How come when we have only ONE mass, there is still a center of mass force being applied? is that correct? 
	I guess if you look at the implementation it's not a bug because of this line : 
				centerMassVector = new Vector(centerMassVector);
			this ^ is independent of whether we have additional masses in play. but is this line correct?
