Notes to Alex: 

I'll keep this short because the bulk of our reflection will be in our Project Analysis.

Even though our code initially was not structured in a way conducive to implementing a Force hierarchy, we took your advice and implemented the Force hierarchy. While this increased the number of classes by four, it greatly simplified and cleaned our code. Our Mass.java went from over 500 lines of code into ~ 130. 

Ultimately, we have implemented the code to be neater and more modular.
